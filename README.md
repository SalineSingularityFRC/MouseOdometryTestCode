This is where the Saline Singularity Programmers will write the mathematical code for the Mouse Odometry project. Once the code has been tested and works properly, we will transfer our code to our 2017 project.

The goal of the Mouse Odometry Project is to use four (or any number 2 or greater) of computer mice mounted on the underside of the robot to track the robot's x and y position on the field as well as its rotation. This will be useful for programming consisitent autonomous sequences.

We would be happy to share our work with other teams who would like to implement similar systems!

Note: to maximize mouse polling rate we appended " usbhid.mousepoll=0 " to the raspberry pi's /boot/cmdline.txt
